# Christmas Tree

Completed in **2015.** for fun, in the first semester of freshman year of college.
<br/>Description: The user inputs a number - _n_. A Christmas tree is generated. The inputed number _n_ represents the number of layers in one tier of the tree.
<br/>**NOTE:** This code is purposely left unrefactored. :blush:
